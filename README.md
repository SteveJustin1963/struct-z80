# struct-z80

macros for structured programming in Z80 assembly language. 

...the lack of high-level control and looping structures in Z80 assembly language can make implementing algorithms complex. 

John has developed a set of macros inspired by 
- coding patterns in Forth, which allow for structured programming in assembly language.
- "struct-macros.z80" file in your project for control structures such as 
  - if-else, 
  - switch-case, 
  - and loops. 
  - "dloop-macros.z80" file for loop-related structures like do-while, until, break, and continue.
